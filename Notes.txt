-- You'll receive basically npx CRA with a food.json to be used as information and some style-guide (example how to implement AntD) 
    - The instructions will tell you to use a component library "Ant Design" 
    => This can throw some problems with alignments at some point,
       focus on functionality first and after give a nice looking :) 

-- Inside style-guide folder you have some guidance 
    - If you use it, understand what is written there and SOME fields should be changed
    => FoodBox.example.js "FOOD_CALORIES_HERE" should be changed, for example

-- You'll have to pass some functions from parent to children components, like the "delete" and the one to "search"
    - Don't forget to pass and receive the props

-- As a Super Bonus: 
    - Try to the delay from the Search Bar (if yours have the delay, mine had :) )
